# reactB64
Just a simple Base64 translator

## Instructions
Just run `yarn` or `npm install` (in case you don't have yarn installed yet), that will install all the dependencies.
Once it finished installing, run:
`npm run dev` and go to `localhost:8080' to see it in action.

If you would like to build it, then stop the dev server and do: `npm run build`

Thanks for looking!
